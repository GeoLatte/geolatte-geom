Geolatte-geom is a Geometry model for Java that conforms to the Simple Features For SQL specification 1.2.1.

It is intended as a drop-in replacement for the Java Topology Suite (JTS) geometry model. GeoLatte-geom is fully interoperable with JTS but offers the following additional features:
- immutable data structures (Geometries are value objects).
- support for 3D, 2DM and 3DM geometries
- support for several dialects of WKT/WKB (Postgis, Sql Server, SFS 1.21)
- pluggable, extendable Geometry operations
- CRS-awareness (knowledge of coordinate reference system (projected/geodetic, angular units of metres)
- geodetic operations (length, distance and area calculations)
