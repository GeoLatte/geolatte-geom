<p>A model for geospatial geometries.</p>

<H1>Introduction</H1>

<p>The Geolatte Geometry Library is based on the following open standards:</p>
<ul>
    <li>SQL/MM - part 3: Spatial (ISO/IEC 13249-3)</li>
    <li><a href="http://portal.opengeospatial.org/files/?artifact_id=25355">Simple Feature Access - Part 1: common architecture</a></li>
</ul>

<!-- TODO expand with sections on how to create geometries, the PointSequence model, etc.-->
