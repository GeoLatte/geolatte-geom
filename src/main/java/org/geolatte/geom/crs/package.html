      This package contains classes that model Coordinate Reference Systems. The model is based on the
      "OpenGIS Implementation Specification: Coordinate Transformation Services" (rev. 1.00). This document
      is referred to as [CTS-1.00].

      The Coordinate Reference Systems determine the interpretation in 2D of the {@code Coordinate}s.
